Check out the other items we offer from Charles Owen\\xa0Here! What is MIPS helmet technology?MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) is an additional brain protection system.The MIPS system was invented in 1996 in Sweden by Hans von Holst, a neurosurgeon and Peter Halldin, a researcher from the Royal Institute of Technology.MIPS is designed to add protection against rotational motion (or kinematics) transmitted to the brain from angled impacts to the head, which is how most riders fall.Rotational motion is a combination of rotational energy (angular velocity) and rotational forces from angular acceleration that both affect the brain and increase the risk for minor and severe brain injuries.MIPS’ added protection system has been proven to reduce rotational motion when implemented in a helmet by redirecting energies and forces otherwise transmitted to the brain.How does MIPS work? MIPS is an additional liner that is incorporated inside the riding helmet.This low-friction layer enables your head to move 10-15mm in all directions, which has been proven to reduce the rotational movement to the brain and therefore injury (particularly concussion and traumatic brain injury).The core idea behind MIPS is to simulate and enhance the brain’s own protection system, which uses the same principle of the brain being able to slide a little bit against the skull.

Check out the other items we offer from Charles Owen\\xa0Here! What is MIPS helmet technology?MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) is an additional brain protection system.The MIPS system was invented in 1996 in Sweden by Hans von Holst, a neurosurgeon and Peter Halldin, a researcher from the Royal Institute of Technology.MIPS is designed to add protection against rotational motion (or kinematics) transmitted to the brain from angled impacts to the head, which is how most riders fall.Rotational motion is a combination of rotational energy (angular velocity) and rotational forces from angular acceleration that both affect the brain and increase the risk for minor and severe brain injuries.MIPS’ added protection system has been proven to reduce rotational motion when implemented in a helmet by redirecting energies and forces otherwise transmitted to the brain.How does MIPS work? MIPS is an additional liner that is incorporated inside the riding helmet.This low-friction layer enables your head to move 10-15mm in all directions, which has been proven to reduce the rotational movement to the brain and therefore injury (particularly concussion and traumatic brain injury).The core idea behind MIPS is to simulate and enhance the brain’s own protection system, which uses the same principle of the brain being able to slide a little bit against the skull.

Stylish look with black matte gloss finish. The ventilation holes act as both a decorative detail and provide a good breathing function to the helmet. The liner (inner lining) has our Coolmax® technology that keeps you dry and gives a comfortable feeling by transporting away moisture. Coolmax® is designed to keep you dry and increase your comfort. Made of specially treated polyester fiber with a unique surface construction that transports moisture away from the skin out through the outer layer of the fabric. There, moisture dries faster than any other fabric and thus regulates the temperature of the skin by condensation cooling .The lining is removable and can be easily washed clean with lukewarm water. The Pardus model is adjustable and best fits slightly oblong heads versus round heads. Regardless of the head shape, choose a size slightly larger against the previous helmet.\\xa0 EQ3 Pardus has MIPS Technology (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) and is a system placed inside the helmet, designed to protect the brain by reducing the harmful forces (including rotational forces) in case of possible a fall.\\xa0Imported.CAUTION: Safety equipment must fit properly and be appropriately secured with manufacture approved parts only. Altering or adding to safety equipment voids warranty and can result in injury. As a safety precaution, inspect all products prior to each use.For additional information on fit, watch our video on how to fit your helmet.\\xa0Click Here! Mips stands for Multi-directional Impact Protection System. The system is built into the helmet, designed to protect the brain by reducing the harmful forces in case of falls from a horse.How does Mips work? Mips act as an extra shell inside the helmet and allow the helmet to rotate in all directions without affecting the head. But in other words, the helmet takes care of the rotational forces in the event of a fall from the horse, not your head. Therefore, it goes without saying that our riding helmets should be equipped with Mips® safety system.Why do I need Mips? If you fall from a height or fall, you are more likely to hit your head obliquely from the side than to land straight on your head. Oblique impact creates a rotational movement to which the brain is very sensitive. At best, in the event of a hard blow, you'll be fine with a minor concussion. If you're really unlucky, your brain tissue could be damaged.How are our riding helmets tested? Our riding helmets are tested in two versions; one with and one without Mips. To be approved, helmets need to reduce rotational forces by at least 10%. In most cases, our helmets significantly exceed this limit. Helmets are impact tested on the forehead, from the side, from the top, and the side from the front. The tests take place on all models and sizes, and are documented both via sensors and high-speed cameras. Back on Track Helmets have won numerous BEST IN TEST AWARDS. \\xa0MIPS Technology  COOL MAX Technology  Vented MIPS security system Front and rear ventilation  Washable function lining  Three-point bracket Approved for riding in all disciplines Certified by SEI (Safety Equipment Institute), MIPS, COOL MAX, Brain Protection System CE VG1 01.040 2014-12 and EN1384.2017 Key Specifications MIPS: Yes ASTM/SEI: Yes VG1: Yes View full specifications   STILL HAVE QUESTIONS?

The filling is primarily created from renewable plant-based materials and is ECO efficient. Dupont® faux down is smooth and contains several air pockets. Back on Track chose this material due to their brand values; to create well-being for human and animals. Thanks to the faux down the vest remains warm even if it gets wet.\\xa0 Completed with faux leather logo at the chest and two hidden front pockets with concealed zippers.\\xa0 Features include: iontex®, synthetic down, hidden pockets, lightweight,\\xa0 tailored fit.\\xa0ImportedInstructions for Use: Please read carefully, both the usage and washing instructions before using the product.All Back on Track products should be introduced gradually. To start with, use the product for a maximum of 4 to 6 hours a day for the first 2-3 days. The body then has the opportunity to familiarize itself with the fabric’s effects. \\xa0 The reason we recommend starting with a maximum of 4 to 6 hours use is that, due to an increase in circulation and energy, the products' effects can, in rare instances, produce an uncomfortable feeling.\\xa0 Depending on your horse's condition, those that are particularly stiff and sore, might experience a slight amount of pain and or swelling. This is due to the increased blood circulation and energy flow, which is actually a positive indication that the mineralized ceramic fabric is taking effect. This initial manifestation if any, can occur anytime during the first couple hours of use, and if this occurs, we recommend discontinuing use for the remainder of the day, and then introduce it more gradually over the following days.Horse & Pet: After the introductory period, you can increase the in-stall (or resting) use to 8 hours per day or overnight. After only an hour or so, there is often perceived a positive effect on tight muscles and stiff joints. More persistent problems may require more time, usually between 10 and 20 days before the desired result is fully achieved.Human: After the introductory period of 2 to 3 days, it is important to continue to use the product intensively up to 20 days, before assessing the products impact. Since the mineralized ceramic fabric reflects more of the body’s energy as you move, the effect is greatest if you wear the product when active. However, Back on Track products also work when resting, even during sleep.Continue to use the product according to the routine you develop, then after intensive use (up to 20 days), it is recommended to take a break in order to avoid dependency - this cycle of use and non-use is recommended throughout the lifecycle of the product. The sensitivity of this dependency varies from individual to individual and from animal to animal. For maximum effect, the mineral infused ceramic fabric best performs when in direct contact with the skin or coat, however, significant benefits are realized even when worn as outerwear.Note: Caution is advised during simultaneous use with liniment or similar topical applications, since the effect is amplified. Use the product only as directed and consult a doctor if symptoms persist. Consult with your veterinarian or health care practitioner if you are pregnant before use.Lightweight with DuPont filling and has an elegant design that fits every occasion.
